ðŸ’¥ Features

## Customer View 

- bamazonCustomer.js display the products available in the database and allow the user to choose on product to  purchase and the quantity desired.

- The app prompt users with two messages.

   * The first ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

- Once the customer has placed the order, the application check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

   * If not, the app log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.

- if your store _does_ have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
   * This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
   * Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
   * returns to the main menu for a new purchase

## Manager View 

* bamazonManager.js Running this application will:

  * List a set of menu options:

    * View Products for Sale
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product

  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app lists every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

  * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it lists all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app displays a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it allows the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
